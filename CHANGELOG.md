This is a history of changes to k13labs/clara-rules.

# 1.4.0-SNAPSHOT
* update linter config for new macros.

* extract clara.rules.compiler/compile-test-handler from clara.rules.compiler/compile-test
* add support for `env` inside of test expressions
* use `.clj_kondo` extension for clj-kondo hook code for better tool compatibility (clj-kondo support now requires clj-kondo 2022.04.25 or higher)
* Include the invalid constraint in the exception thrown at session compilation time when negations have multiple children.  See [Issue 284](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/284).

### 0.22.1
* fix incorrent lint warning triggered when this binding is not used in clj-kondo hooks

### 0.22.0
* add built-in clj-kondo support for clara-rules as hooks. Importing should be automatic if using clojure-lsp; for detailed instructions see clj-kondo's documentation on [how to import clj-kondo configuration](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/blob/master/doc/config.md#importing)
* use correct arity calling `->RuleOrderedActivation` constructor during serialization if clara session; this change should have the same effective behavior as before.

### 0.21.2
* Try and catch TestNode expression evaluation so that exceptions thrown are re-thrown wrapped in a condition exception which includes production name and bindings information. See [PR 471](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/pull/471).

### 0.21.1
* Add support to specify query binding arguments as symbols instead of only keywords so that defquery syntax looks closer to function definition syntax. See [PR 463](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/pull/463).

### 0.21.0
* Add names to anonymous functions generated by rule compilation; these names will be in the class names of the generated objects. [Issue 261](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/261) and [issue 291](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/291)
* Add types information to alpha nodes. [Issue 237](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/237)
* Fix a bug related to Java object facts with IndexedPropertyDescriptor fields. [Issue 446](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/446)

* Add an optional listener that reports suspected infinite loops of rules.  [Issue 275](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/275)

### 0.20.0
* Add a flag to omit compilation context (used by the durability layer) after Session compilation to save space when not needed. Defaults to true. [issue 422](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/422)
* Correct duplicate bindings within the same condition. See [issue 417](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/417)
* Correct sharing of nodes with different parents. See [issue 433](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/433)

### 0.19.1
* Added a new field to the clara.rules.engine/Accumulator record.  This could be a breaking change for any user durability implementations with low-level performance optimizations.  See [PR 410](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/pull/410) for details.
* Performance improvements for :exists conditions.  See [issue 298](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/298).
* Decrease memory usage post deserialization (Durability). See [Issue 419](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/419)
* Added a new function that returns the number of times a rule was interacted with as a proxy for rules that may be the cause of performance problems.  This function requires information from the [tracing listener](http://www.clara-rules.org/docs/listeners/) to work.  See [issue 344](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/344) for details.

### 0.19.0

### 0.18.0
* Remove unnecessary memory operations from ProductionNode to optimize performance.  Remove :rule-matches in session inspection that did not cause logical insertions and add a new optional feature to return all rule matches, regardless of what their RHS did or whether they were retracted. Add a new listener and tracing method fire-activation!. These changes are moderately non-passive with respect to listening, tracing, and session inspection but are otherwise passive.  See [issue 386](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/386) for details.
* Support keyword names for use in custom DSLs. See [issue 371](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/371) for details.

* Refactor defrule and defquery to better support customization. See [issue 362](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/362) for details.

### 0.16.1
* Fix deserialization failure when the rulebase contains a clojure.lang.PersistentList$EmptyList. See [issue 352](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/352) for details.
* Fix bug in which bindings from previous conditions could be ignored in negations of compound boolean expressions.  See [issue 304](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/304) for details.

* Refactored session inspection in [PR 339](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/pull/339), which is also expected to improve the performance of session inspection.

### 0.16.0
* Eliminate laziness that broke internal contracts around order of execution, causing an exception to be thrown when executing queries with negation conditions in some edge cases.  See [issue 303](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/303) for details.

### 0.15.2
* Fix a bug in the distinct accumulator.  See [issue 325](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/325).

### 0.15.1
* Do not resolve condition type symbols in the Clojure environment. See [issue 300](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/300).
* Add def-rules-test macro. See [issue 296](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/296).
* Support tracing in ClojureScript. See [issue 308](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/308).
* Upgrade Schema version.

### 0.15.0
* Provide information on facts accumulated over, not just the result of the accumulation, in session inspection.  This is a breaking change to the structure of the clara.tools.inspect.Explanation record.  The information available in the Explanation record now is a superset of that available in 0.14.0.  See [issue 276](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/276) for further details.
* Fix a memory leak in which the memory held references to bindings from retracted facts.  Fixing this leak also fixed some incorrect return data in session inspection. See [issue 280](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/280) for details.
* Added a feature that uses data from session inspection to create a directed
graph of facts to logical insertions as a result of those facts. See [issue 277](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/277) for details.
* Remove the unused input-condition field from the clara.rules.engine.Accumulator record. See [issue 287](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/287) for details.
* Return information on matches for negation conditions in session inspection. See [issue 289](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/289) for details.
* Extend the fix for incorrect handling of nested complex negation conditions [issue 149](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/149) to ClojureScript; see [issue 241](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/241) for details.

### 0.14.0
* Fixed a bug where variables bindings created in constraints could be missed by subsequent constraints in the same condition.  See [issue 267](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/267) for details.
* Delayed inserting and retracting facts until fire-rules is called.  Some queries that would reflect changes to the rules network immediately after insertions and retractions now will not reflect these changes until after fire-rules is called.  See [issue 268](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/268) for further details and discussion of the reasons for this change.
* Added an experimental performance optimization option to allow insertions and retractions of equal facts to cancel each other out during rules firing. See [issue 249](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/249) for details.

### 0.13.0
* This release includes all changes in the previous 0.13.0-RC releases as well as improvements to error handling in the LHS discussed at [issue 255](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/255).  Most notably relative to the 0.12.0 release, this replaces the previous durability implementation with a much more robust and performant one as discussed at [issue 198](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/198).

### 0.13.0-RC7
* The work to improve batching in order to improve performance at [issue 236](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/236) didn't actually improve performance for reasons discussed and fixed at [issue 257](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/257).

### 0.13.0-RC6
This release is mostly for performance improvements to durability over 0.13.0-RC5.

* Lookup of the record factory functions during serialization is now cached. See [issue 245](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/245) and [issue 253](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/253).
* Removes undesired interaction of metadata on rules and queries that are built outside defrule and defquery with Clara's compiler that caused session compilation to fail. No sessions that previously compiled should be impacted by this change. See [pull request 243](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/pull/243).
* Elements and tokens that are identical by reference before serialization are now identical by reference after deserialization.  See [issue 247](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/247).
* Replaces dynamic vars with JVM ThreadLocals in durability to improve performance.  See [pull request 251](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/pull/251).
* Fixes an edge case where a retraction could be duplicated. See [issue 250](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/250).

### 0.13.0-RC5
*  The get-alphas-fn is now shared between deserialized sessions with the same rulebase to increase the performance benefit from caching.   Note that this a non-passive change to the experimental durability API. See [issue 234](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/234).
* Improve performance on the JVM when productions have a type that has multiple descendant types that are found in the session. See [issue 236](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/236).
* Improve performance on the JVM by replacing internal use of Clojure's hierarchies with class-based dispatch. See [issue 239](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/239).

### 0.13.0-RC4

* The project is now moved to the com.cerner group and [Cerner's GitHub organization](https://github.com/cerner/).
* Avoid unneeded retractions through negation nodes. See [issue 231](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/231).

### 0.13.0-RC3
Bug fixes over 0.13.0-RC2

* Improve performance by processing external retractions as a batch. See [issue 225](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/225).
* Handle sorted collections in durability logic. See [PR 228](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/pull/228).
* Remove redundant retract calls to the change listener. See [PR 227](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/pull/227/files).


### 0.13.0-RC2

* clara.rules/mk-session now loads rules stored in a var if given a qualified symbol for that var. See [issue 177](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/177).

### 0.10.0
Clara 0.10 is compatible with previous versions, with a couple caveats. These are:

* The intermediate representation of the Rete network changed as reflected in schema updates in clara.rules.schema. This only affects users that build tooling that inspect the network structure.
* The order of rule ordering and the state of queries prior to (fire-rules) being called may have changed. This ordering was not guaranteed previously, but users may have depended on it accidentally.
* ClojureScript users will need to use ClojureScript 1.7.170 or newer.

* Clean up reflection warnings.

### 0.6.0
* Several performance optimizations described in [issue 56](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/56) and [this blog post](http://www.toomuchcode.org/blog/2014/06/16/micro-bench-macro-optimize/).
* Session durability as an experimental feature. See [issue 16](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/16) and [the wiki](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/wiki/Durability).
* Improved ability to inspect session state and explain why rules and queries were activated. See the [inspection page on the wiki](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/wiki/Inspection) for details.
* A list of smaller changes can be seen via the [milestone summary](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues?milestone=8&page=1&state=closed)

### 0.5.0
Contains several bug fixes and some usage enhancements, including:

* The clara.tools.inspect package allows for inspection and explanation of why rules fired. Also see [issue 48](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/48).
* [File and line information is preserved when compiling.](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/pull/51)
* A list of several other fixes can be seen via the [milestone summary](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues?milestone=7&page=1&state=closed)
